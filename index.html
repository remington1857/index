<section class="about">
Dewey Shackelly is a social documentary Photographer. He is a member of the Nooaitch Indian Band of the Nlakapa'mux Nation located in the Central Interior of British Columbia, Canada

In 2010, Dewey discovered his passion for social documentary photogarphy and started his company called 'Remington John Photography'. He has travelled throughout Western Canada shooting various events including rodeos, powwows, round dances, birthdays, weddings, landscapes, sports, nature and portrait photography. Dewey strongly believes that it's not just the camera, but who's behind the lens. When people ask what equipment he uses - he tells them, 'My eyes'.

When he is not out shooting, framing or hanging someone, you can usually find Dewey editing pictures on his computer, which is another one of lifetime passions.
